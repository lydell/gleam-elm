# elm_compat

[![Package Version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/elm_compat)](https://hex.pm/packages/elm_compat)
[![Hex Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/hex-docs-ffaff3)](https://hexdocs.pm/elm_compat/)

All `elm/*` packages ported to Gleam. `elm/*` packages are implemented partially in Elm, and partially in plain JavaScript. The Elm parts have been translated to Gleam. The JavaScript parts have been copy-pasted as-is and have then been adjusted slightly to work with Gleam.

The idea is that this could help you migrate an existing Elm app to Gleam. If youâ€™re starting from scratch, you might want to check out [Lustre](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre) instead.

```sh
gleam add elm_compat@1
```
```gleam
import elm/browser

pub fn main(args) {
  debugger.element(
    init:,
    view:,
    update:,
    flags_decoder:,
    subscriptions:,
    effect_managers: [],
  )(args)
}
```
